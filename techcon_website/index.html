            <p>CareerConnections is an intense 2-hour recruiting event. Technical staff and recruiters from SRC member companies are on hand to provide information to our SRC Research Scholars about each company. During this event, resumes and contact information are exchanged, while many companies actively recruit for open and upcoming job and internship opportunities. If you are looking to find a job or fill a job requisition, this is the place to do it!</p>
